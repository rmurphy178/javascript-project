# JamzBoard

JamzBoard (https://rmurphy178.github.io/javascript-project/) is an interactive sound board app that allows users to superimpose sound effects over an audio track. Users generate sound effects by clicking on or dragging across squares on the board to activate or deactivate them. Squares produce a sound when activated and when passed over by the looping sequencer bar if they are active. Sounds can also be produced through the keyboard below the sound board.
